# Vitl technical test by David Roberts (david.j.roberts303@gmail.com)

https://github.com/djr303/vitl-technical-test

### Environment, run and build information

Tested on NodeJS v14.17.0, Yarn v1.22.00 & Chrome v91.0.4472.77 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### To install dependencies and run locally:

`$ yarn && yarn start`

## Note on further work

* I would consider a full set of unit test and browser automation tests
* I would improve the responsive layout for all device sizes
* I would add animation feedback on hover and user action
* I would consider other data structure to improve performance on larger data sets
